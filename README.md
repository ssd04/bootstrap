# Boostrapping scripts

Setup Ubuntu / Arch systems automatically.

## TODOs

- documentation in script help and in `Makefile`
- add multiple columns for package category (like base, dev, academic) in
  `programs.csv` and install the packages based on that, which can be specified
  and cli arg
- maybe different column in csv file if package name differs for arch linux
- separate setup for development env, to be able to choose based on different
  languages
